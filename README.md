# Nature Petition System - README

Welcome to the **Nature Petition System**, a decentralized application (dApp) that allows users to connect their Ethereum wallet, view petitions, and vote for initiatives they care about. This application is built with React and uses the Ethereum blockchain for managing petitions and votes.

## Features
- **Connect MetaMask Wallet**: Enables users to interact with the dApp using their MetaMask wallet.
- **View Petitions**: Displays a list of active petitions retrieved from the Ethereum smart contract.
- **Vote for Petitions**: Allows users to vote for petitions directly from the app.
- **Real-time Updates**: Reflects updated vote counts and total votes instantly after interactions.

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:
git clone <repository-url> cd nature-petition-system

2. Install dependencies:
npm install

3. Start the development server:
npm start

4. Ensure your Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask) is set up and connected to the correct network.

## Key Components

5. **`fetchPetitions`**: Retrieves the list of petitions from the smart contract.
6. **`fetchTotalVotes`**: Fetches the total number of votes from the smart contract.
7. **`voteForPetition`**: Submits a vote for a specific petition and updates the UI with new data.
8. **`initUser`**: Handles conditional rendering based on the wallet and account connection state.
